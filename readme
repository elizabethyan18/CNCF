Running e2e conformace testing in focus mode: 

Download sonobuoy tar file:
wget https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/sonobuoy/release/download/v0.55.1/sonobuoy_0.55.1_linux_amd64.tar.gz

Extract file:
tar -xzvf ~/sonobuoy_0.55.1_linux_amd64.tar.gz

Run TC: 
./sonobuoy run --e2e-focus=",string - TC name>" --wait

Show results:
outfile=$(./sonobuoy retrieve) && ./sonobuoy results $outfile

To clearn up Kubenetes objects created by sonobuoy, run
sonobuoy delete

We have one failed TC, we have reported this issue in https;//issueexplorer.com/
https://issueexplorer.com/issue/kubenetes/kubebetes/105039
Note:
There is no fix for the issue. There was a try to change the test case to run "ingress resource create" just once in the "e2e test suite" but it was rejected by the community. 
For reference see: https://gitbub.com/kubenetes/kubenetes/pull/100449
There is a comment on https://issueexplorer.comissue/kubenetes/kubenetes/105039 saying that we should not run"e2e tests" on an existing cluster with validation webhook from specific Ingress Controllers
